## What is this?
Hi! This is a website in a similar vein as Expedia. Load up the page, type in parameters, and click Find Flights. You will be brought a page that will showcase all the flights available. You may then proceed to "book" a flight, and then retrieve various information. Planned are some other fun stuff like a boarding pass PDF builder, among other things.

## Where else can I follow development?
Well if you want to check this out, I'm keeping track of all the big updates I do on my new YouTube channel built primarily for this purpose! Come check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTbOijtc8Y-LAi9j83ZUpgna6SqdYTpSj
