## What is this?
Hi! This is a website in a similar vein as Expedia. Load up the page, type in parameters, and click Find Flights. You will be brought a page that will showcase all the flights available. You may then proceed to "book" a flight, and then retrieve various information. Planned are some other fun stuff like a boarding pass PDF builder, among other things.

## Where else can I follow development?
Well if you want to check this out, I'm keeping track of all the big updates I do on my new YouTube channel built primarily for this purpose! Come check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTbOijtc8Y-LAi9j83ZUpgna6SqdYTpSj 

## To run the code
Open up command prompt, navigate to the directory this is stored, then type ```npm init```. It should download all the proper packages to launch. Then type ```npm start``` to start the server. If it does not open right away, go to your browser and type ```localhost:3000``` this should open up the website!
